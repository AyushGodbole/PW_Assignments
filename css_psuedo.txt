Q-1 Why is it called a pseudo-class?
It's called a "pseudo-class" because "pseudo" means something that's not exactly real or genuine, and "class" refers to how we style elements with a specific class name in HTML. Pseudo-classes are used to style elements in specific situations, like when they're hovered over or clicked, but they're not actual classes defined in the HTML.

Q-2 What are gradients in CSS?
Gradients in CSS are like smooth color blends. They let you create backgrounds or decorative effects that change smoothly from one color to another. There are two main types: linear gradients, which blend colors along a straight line, and radial gradients, which blend colors outward from a central point.

Q-3 What are different types of transitions in CSS?
CSS transitions make property changes happen smoothly over time instead of instantly. There are a few parts to a transition:

transition-property: This says which properties should transition (like width or color).
transition-duration: This says how long the transition should take.
transition-timing-function: This controls how fast the transition goes at different points in time (like starting fast and slowing down).
transition-delay: This adds a delay before the transition starts.
