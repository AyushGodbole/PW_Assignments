Q-1 Position Property and Types:
The position property in CSS determines how an element is positioned on a web page. There are five types:

1.Static: Default positioning; follows the normal document flow.
2.Relative: Positioned relative to its normal position, can be shifted using top, bottom, left, or right.
3.Absolute: Positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, or the initial containing block if none; taken out of the normal document flow.
4.Fixed: Positioned relative to the browser window; remains fixed even when scrolling.
5.Sticky: Initially in normal flow, becomes fixed based on scroll position.

Q-2 Types of Positioning:
CSS offers five main positioning types:

1.Static: Default positioning; elements follow normal document flow.
2.Relative: Positioned relative to normal position; can be shifted using top, bottom, left, or right.
3.Absolute: Positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor or initial containing block if none; taken out of normal flow.
4.Fixed: Positioned relative to browser window; remains fixed during scrolling.
5.Sticky: Initially in normal flow, becomes fixed based on scroll position.

Q-3 Z-index and Its Use:
Z-index is a CSS property controlling the vertical stacking order of overlapping elements. It's crucial for:

1.Managing the order of elements visually.
2.Higher Z-index values place elements above those with lower values.
3.Works only on positioned elements.
4.Useful for ensuring specific elements, like navigation bars, remain visible atop others.
5.Values can be positive, negative, or zero, affecting stacking order accordingly.
6.Combined with other CSS properties, Z-index enables complex layout and design effects.
