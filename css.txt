Q-1 What is CSS and why use it?
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used in web development to style and format web pages. It separates the visual design from the content, allowing developers to define how HTML elements should appear. CSS ensures design consistency, improves website performance, enhances accessibility, and enables responsive web design.

Q-2 What are the different ways to bring CSS into HTML file?
There are three main ways to add CSS to an HTML file:

1.External CSS: Create a separate .css file and link it using the <link> tag in the HTML <head> section.
2.Internal CSS: Use the <style> tag in the HTML <head> section to define CSS rules within the document.
3.Inline CSS: Apply styles directly to HTML elements using the style attribute within the element.

External CSS is suitable for larger websites, internal CSS for small sites, and inline CSS for quick styling changes.

Q-3 What do you mean by specificity in CSS?
Specificity in CSS determines which style rule takes precedence when multiple rules target the same element. It's measured in points, based on the selectors used:

1.Element selectors have 1 point.
2.Class and attribute selectors have 10 points.
3.ID selectors have 100 points.
4.Inline styles have 1000 points.
5.The rule with the highest specificity points is applied to the element.
