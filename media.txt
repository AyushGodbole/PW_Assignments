2.Customizing font size and colors.
3.Checking viewport width and height.
4.Adapting styles based on device orientation.
5.Adjusting styles based on device resolution.

Q-2 Difference between min-width and max-width in media queries in CSS?

1.min-width: Styles apply when viewport width is equal to or greater than the specified value.
2.max-width: Styles apply when viewport width is equal to or less than the specified value.
